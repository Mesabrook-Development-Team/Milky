# Milky
A simply dairy mod that adds liquid milk. May cause stomach troubles in players with lactose intolerance.

## Features
* Liquid Milks (Regular, Chocolate, Strawberry, Caramel)
* Bottled Milks!
  * Regular Milk: Removes all potion effects.
  * Chocolate Milk: Gives Fire Resistance I.
  * Strawberry Milk: Gives Jump Boost I.
  * Caramel Milk: Gives Health Boost I.

<i>You can disable the potion effects in Milky's config file</i>

## Known Issues
* Right-clicking any milk fluid with a Glass Bottle gives the player a Water Bottle.
* The vanilla Milk Bucket does not behave properly with tanks. ASM will be needed to fix this by completely replacing the normal Milk Bucket with our own.

  * Mod is required in order to produce the Strawberry or Caramel Milks.
* Immersive Engineering
  * The Mixer is required to make flavored milks.
  * The Squeezer can squeeze Pam's Harvestcraft Soy Beans to make Milk.

## Planned Features ðŸ‘€
* An automated milking machine block that'll extract milk from any Cow that's standing on top of it.
